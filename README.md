# Knocky: Reborn

The native Knockout.chat forum client!

Now rebuilt from the ground up, with fewer dependencies, and more polished!

## Features

Supports nearly all of the features of the web frontend.
It also has self-updating, and will inform if there is an update

## Missing features

* Post reporting
* Searching
* Thread hiding

## Planned features

* Tablet design

## Why is it not on Google play?

It's because knockout.chat has NSFW content, and if I want to release it there, I would be forced to implement age verification.

## Privacy

The app includes firebase, for tracking installs. It does not collect any other data. 

Best way to keep updated is, joining the Discord server: https://discord.gg/4AnpprqK
